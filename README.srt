**REST-API**
============

A primitive PostgreSQL driven API. 

- Allows HTTP based interation with database
- Supports basic CRUD operations

Currently works with one database(moviedb) and two tables(movies and ratings). Originally built with SQLite (sqlite3 module in Python) then switched to PostgreSQL. Used micro web-framework Bottle and plugin pgsql.

A project for learning networking and database basics.
